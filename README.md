# CST
Client Site Tools

Use Powershell script platform combined with Winform C# to create a friendly GUI with purpose:
- A GUI that anyone can click, don't have to know too much code.
- An admin account can be embeded into the GUI via PS2EXE Module to allow standard user perform some non-standard command.
- All scripts are converted into one .exe file so admin account won't be exposed.
